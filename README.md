# Dijkstra Search Algorithm: Tintin and criminals

## Summery:
In this project, we first create 3 random functions and investigate if they are convex or concave by plotting them. Then by using different algorithms we find the optimum point and investigate which algorithm works better for the convex/concave function. 

## Optimization Algorithm:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Newton-Raphson
3. Simulated Annealing
